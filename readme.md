# NHS Benchmarking via Webscraping

## How it works
Each month NHS England publishes data that every NHS Hospital in the UK submits for the key target indicators for 
Admissions, Emergency Departments and Cancer.

Running this pipeline will scrape the web using beautiful soup to download all available files, then transform them into usable data.

## Installing dependencies
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
